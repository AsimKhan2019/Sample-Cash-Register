#### Sample Programming Challenge
## The Problem - Grocery Store Cash Register

In this sample you will implement a grocery store cash register.  Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill.  Items are charged for in a couple of different ways.

    * A given price for each item, eg. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each
    
    * A given price by weight, eg. Apples are $2.49 per pound
    
    * Items can be go on sale where you might receive bulk discounts,
      eg. Buy two get one free sales are also available
    
    * Coupons are available to get money off the bill when the total amount
      is above a threshold, eg. $5 off when you spend $100 or more

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your coding style, Object-Oriented Design skills and functional completeness.
